* Rewritten internal mod structure (the whole thing!)
    * One mod ID with modules (higher granularity than previously) configurable in config/charset/modules.
    * The above, of course, makes "@Charset" work in JEI.

* [lib] [#123] Work around issues with mods which change wood recipes, like BetterWithMods
* [misc.drama] [#120] Fix IllegalArgumentException
* [misc.scaffolds] Improved JEI support.
* [pipes] [#121] Fix Shifter crashes
* [pipes] Add support for CommonCapabilities' IInventoryState for further optimizations.
* [storage.barrels] Fixed many issues with barrel carts.
* [storage.barrels] Improved JEI support.
* [storage.barrels] Sticky barrel upgrade can now use OreDict-ed slimeballs.
* [storage.tanks] New module! Who doesn't like BuildCraft-styled tanks?
* [tweak.disableItemTooltips] New tweak! Off by default.
* [tweak.pushableTnt] Fix unlocalized TNT name.
* [tweak.unifyColors] New tweak! Unifies wool/stained glass/stained clay colors.
    * Dynamic - works with resource packs!
    * To change the colors, create your own assets/charset/color_palette.json.
    * Note that stained clay takes on some of the tint of the hardened clay.
