* Rewritten internal mod structure (the whole thing!)
    * One mod ID with modules (higher granularity than previously) configurable in config/charset/modules.cfg
* [storage.barrels] Fixed many issues with barrel carts.
* [tweak.pushableTnt] Fix unlocalized TNT name.
* [tweak.unifyColors] New tweak! Unifies wool/stained glass/stained clay colors.
    * Dynamic - works with resource packs!
    * To change the colors, create your own assets/charset/color_palette.json.
    * Note that stained clay takes on some of the tint of the hardened clay.
